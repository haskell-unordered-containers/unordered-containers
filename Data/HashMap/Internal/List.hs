-- uc :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a] -> Ordering
-- uc c as bs = compare (sortBy c as) (sortBy c bs)
--
-- But as we have only (a -> b -> Ordering), we cannot directly compare
-- elements from the same list.
--
-- So when comparing elements from the list, we count how many elements are
-- "less and greater" in the other list, and use the count as a metric.
